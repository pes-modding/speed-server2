# SpeedServer2 map.txt format:
# team-id, tournament-id, game-speed
#
# first two fields are optional, but game-speed is required
# - if team-id is omitted, but tournament-id is present,
#   then speed is set for all games in that tournament
# - if team-id is present, but tournament-id is omitted,
#   then speed is set when this team plays home at any tournament.
#
# Anything after "#" symbol is considered a comment and is ignored by map reader
#
# keep in mind that many tournaments have multiple id (Like, UEFA Champions League, for example)
# so you need to add a separate line to the map for each of those ids 
#
# Order of evaluation:
# - more specific rules take precedent over less specific rules
# - competition-wide setting takes precedent over team-specific setting
#   (if you want to change that: assign competition-specific speed for a specific team)
#
#
# Examples:
# ,,-0.65         # Global game speed setting: -0.65
# 101, , 3        # Arsenal plays at game speed 3
# 101, 17, 3.2    # Arsenal plays home matches in England League at game speed 3.2
# , 65535, -1.35  # Exhibition mode game speed: -1.35
